## Building

Building requires Node and PHP. Yeah, I know, Cringe, I was lazy with the html part ðŸ¤£...

1. edit the `config.yml`
2. swap out the assets in the image folder.
3. build using the following commands

```
nvm use
yarn install
yarn run build

composer install
php build.php
```

## Autocomplete Requirements

Your endpoint should accept the following parameters `?query=test&lang=uk-en`

The response should be in the following format:

```
[{"phrase":"test"},{"phrase":"testwise"},{"phrase":"test internet speed"},{"phrase":"testosterone"},{"phrase":"testing"},{"phrase":"test microphone"},{"phrase":"testament"},{"phrase":"test camera"}]
```

I also recommend that you lock it down to specific domains / IP addresses, this will avoid hitting rate limiting and large charges from your provider.

If you are struggling with setting up autocomplete, feel free to message me and I'll try to get back to you with some hints and tips.
